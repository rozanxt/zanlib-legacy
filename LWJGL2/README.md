## ZanLibrary for LWJGL 2

ZanLibrary is a framework and library for simple Java game development.
This project was created to enable programmers to work on a game directly,
without dealing with setups such as window creation or input handling first.
It also includes a wrapper which simplifies the use of OpenGL.

This is a modified version of ZanLibrary used for LWJGL 2 instead of LWJGL 3.
