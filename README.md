## ZanLibrary

ZanLibrary is a framework and library for simple Java game development.
This project was created to enable programmers to work on a game directly,
without dealing with setups such as window creation or input handling first.
It also includes a wrapper which simplifies the use of OpenGL.

Main Features:
- Simple window creation
- Game loop management
- Keyboard and mouse input handling
- Easy-to-use OpenGL wrapper methods for 2D and 3D graphics
- Audio playback
- Socket programming
- Maths library

ZanLibrary uses [LWJGL 3](http://www.lwjgl.org/) and [Paul Lamb's Sound System](http://www.paulscode.com/).
