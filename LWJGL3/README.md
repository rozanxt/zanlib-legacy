ZanLibrary for LWJGL 3
======================

ZanLibrary is a framework and library for simple Java game development.
This project was created to enable programmers to work on a game directly,
without dealing with setups such as window creation or input handling first.
It also includes a wrapper which simplifies the use of OpenGL.

This is the original version of ZanLibrary, which is built on [LWJGL 3](http://www.lwjgl.org/).
